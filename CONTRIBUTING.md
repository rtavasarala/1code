## Open Source vs Hosted Version

This is the open-source version of 1Code. Some features require the hosted backend at 1code.dev:

| Feature | Open Source | Hosted (1code.dev) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Local AI chat | Yes | Yes |
| Claude Code integration | Yes | Yes |
| Git worktrees | Yes | Yes |
| Terminal | Yes | Yes |
| Sign in / Sync | No | Yes |
| Background agents | No | Yes |
| Auto-updates | No | Yes |
| Private Discord & support | No | Yes |
| Early access to new features | No | Yes |

## Analytics & Telemetry

Analytics (PostHog) and error tracking (Sentry) are **disabled by default** in open source builds. They only activate if you set the environment variables in `.env.local`.
